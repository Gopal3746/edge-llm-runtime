# Edge LLM Runtime

A lightweight CPU transformer inference runtime implemented in modern C++.

The project is intended to explore the components behind edge-oriented
large-language-model inference, including tensor operations, transformer
layers, KV caching, quantization, benchmarking, and memory optimization.

## Current Status

The runtime now supports uncached causal attention and KV-cached attention
through separate prefill and single-token decode paths. Prefill projects and
caches the prompt's rotated keys and values, while decode projects only the
new token and attends it against all cached history. Cached outputs are tested
for numerical agreement with full-sequence uncached attention.

## Planned Features

- Contiguous tensor storage and shape validation
- Matrix multiplication and element-wise operations
- RMSNorm and softmax
- Token embeddings and linear layers
- Rotary positional embeddings
- Causal self-attention
- Feed-forward and transformer blocks
- Autoregressive token generation
- KV caching with prefill and decode paths
- INT8 weight quantization
- FP32 and INT8 performance benchmarks
- Linux CPU profiling and buffer reuse

## Requirements

- C++20-compatible compiler
- CMake 3.20 or newer

## Build

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
